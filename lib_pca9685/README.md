# PCA9685 Driver


## <font color=orange>By Devon Piecuch</font>


This is an i2c-driver for the PCA9685 LED-controller. It requires firmware 6.05 or later and works on ESC and Express hardware.
The driver is tested with the Adafruit PCA9685-board as a PWM LED driver but can be adapted to control servos as well.

## FUNCTIONS


### pca9685-init

```clj
(pca9685-init '(pins) i2caddr)
```

Initialize and start the driver on the i2c-pins with the optional I2C device address. If the pins are nil (an empty list) the default pins will be used and if i2caddr is nil the default 0x40 slave address will be used. 

Example:

```clj
(pca9685-init nil nil) ; Initialize using default pins and I2C slave address
(pca9685-init '(3 2) 0x41) ; Initialize using pin 3 for SDA and 2 for SCL on the express firmware and hardware address A0 is used on the pca9685
(pca9685-init '('pin-swdio 'pin-swclk) 0x60) ; Initialize using pin swdio for SDA and swclk for SCL on the ESC-firmware and hardware address A5 is used on the pca9685
```

The function return true if initialization was successful and false otherwise.


## MODE 1 REGISTER FUNCTIONS


### set-sleep 

```clj
(set-sleep)
```

Set the sleep bit.

### set-auto-inc 

```clj
(set-auto-inc enable)
```

Enable/Disable (1/0) auto increment.

### set-ext-clk

```clj
(set-ext-clk enable)
```

Enable/Disable (1/0) external clock.


## MODE 2 REGISTER FUNCTIONS


### set-outne

```clj
(set-outne bit0 bit1)
```

Active LOW output enable input 'OE' pin

param: bit0:(MODE2)OUTNE0 bit1:(MODE2)OUTNE1  

| OUTNE[1:0] | LED outputs |
| --- | --- |
| 00: | 0 \*default |
| 01: | 1 if OUTDRV=1, hi-z OUTDRV=0 |
| 10: | 0 hi-z |
| 11: | 0 hi-z |

### set-outdrv

```clj

param: outdrv= 1:totem pole  0:open drain

Suggested configs: \*see also '(set-inverted)'  
(MODE2)bit2:outdrv

1. LEDs directly connected no ext driver (outdrv:0 invrt:1)
2. N-type Ext. driver used \*DEFAULT (outdrv:1 invrt:0)
3. P-type Ext. driver used (outdrv:1 invrt:1)

### set-och

```clj
(set-och ack)
```

param: Outputs change on: 1=ACK 0=STOP

### set-inverted

```clj
(set-inverted inverted)
```

param: inverted= 1:output polarity is inverted
(MODE2) bit4:invrt
\*see also '(set-outdrv)'


## HELP FUNCTIONS


### is-sleeping

```clj
(is-sleeping)
```

Returns t if sleeping bit is set and nil if board is awake.

### wakeup

```clj
(wakeup)
```

If board is sleeping will try to reset the sleeping bit. Returns t if board is awake.

### set-pwm-freq

```clj
(set-pwm-freq freq)
```

Sets the PWM frequency to a value between 24-1526 hz inclusive.

### set-pwm

```clj
(set-pwm channel on-t off-t)
```

Sets the PWM on/off times for a specific channel. \*see data sheet for help

### write-duty-cycle

```clj
(write-duty-cycle '(data))
```

Write a duty cycle from 0.0-1.0 to multiple channels.

### all-off

```clj
(all-off)
```

Set PWM to default OFF state for all channels

### all-on

```clj
(all-on)
```

Set PWM to default ON state for all channels
